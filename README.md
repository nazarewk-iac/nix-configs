# nix-configs
Repository containing my personal Nix (NixOS, Home Manager etc.) configurations

Currently it's just a copy-paste of my learning experience of configuring:
- first-time NixOS
- ZFS
- Sway WM
- ZSH
- Home Manager

I'm planning to slowly migrate to proper structure of the repository moving stuff around.
